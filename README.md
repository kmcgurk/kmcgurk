### Hello world

I'm Kathryn, a cardiovascular geneticist / bioinformatician at Imperial College London, UK. 

I'm a self-taught R user with some training in bioinformatics and/or statistics from the University Oxford, University of Cambridge, MRC Biostatistics Unit, and Wellcome Trust Genome Campus. I use HPCs, bash, linux, and python, to get the job done, and Rmarkdown and jupyter lab for code! I have a background analysing metabolomic data (bioactive lipids), proteomic data, and now I analyse the UK Biobank data, 100,000 Genomes Project data, and patient genetic and phenotype data [see https://bit.ly/3dubFqy]. 

The code I share here or contribute to elsewhere is usually linked to publications, listed below.
